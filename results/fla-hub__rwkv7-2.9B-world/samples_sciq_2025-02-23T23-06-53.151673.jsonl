Yet diamond is just pure carbon. What is special about this element that makes diamond so hard? Bonds. Chemical bonds. In a perfect diamond crystal, each C atom makes four connections—bonds—to four other C atoms in a three-dimensional matrix. Four is the greatest number of bonds that is commonly made by atoms, so C atoms maximize their interactions with other atoms. This threedimensional array of connections extends throughout the diamond crystal, making it essentially one large molecule. Breaking a diamond means breaking every bond at once. Also, the bonds are moderately strong. There are stronger interactions known, but the carboncarbon connection is fairly strong itself. Not only does a person have to break many connections at once, but also the bonds are strong connections from the start. There are other substances that have similar bonding arrangements as diamond does. Silicon dioxide and boron nitride have some similarities, but neither of them comes close to the ultimate hardness of diamond. How do atoms make compounds?

In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as pulmocutaneous circulation. As shown in Figure 40.4b, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. The two atria (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s ventricle (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often described as having double circulation. Most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in Figure 40.4c. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. Together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth. In mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in Figure 40.4d.

Only some of the organisms in Figure 20.10 have this trait, and to those that do, it is called a shared derived character because this trait derived at some point but does not include all of the ancestors in the tree. The tricky aspect to shared ancestral and shared derived characters is the fact that these terms are relative. The same trait can be considered one or the other depending on the particular diagram being used. Returning to Figure 20.10, note that the amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for the Amniota clade, while having hair is a shared derived character for some organisms in this group. These terms help scientists distinguish between clades in the building of phylogenetic trees.\nQuestion: The amniotic egg is a shared ancestral character for which clade?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " trichina"}, "gen_args_1": {"arg_0": "What is the largest clade in this diagram? Shared Characteristics Organisms evolve from common ancestors and then diversify. Scientists use the phrase “descent with modification” because even though related organisms have many of the same characteristics and genetic codes, changes occur. This pattern repeats over and over as one goes through the phylogenetic tree of life: 1. A change in the genetic makeup of an organism leads to a new trait which becomes prevalent in the group. Many organisms descend from this point and have this trait. New variations continue to arise: some are adaptive and persist, leading to new traits. With new traits, a new branch point is determined (go back to step 1 and repeat).

Sublimation, the conversion of a solid directly to a gas, has an accompanying enthalpy change called the enthalpy of sublimation.\nQuestion: Ionic compounds have strong electrostatic attractions between oppositely charged ions in this?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " regular array"}}, "resps": [[["-19.225141525268555", "False"]], [["-11.941593170166016", "False"]], [["-17.91731834411621", "False"]], [["-1.336413860321045", "True"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-19.225141525268555", "False"], ["-11.941593170166016", "False"], ["-17.91731834411621", "False"], ["-1.336413860321045", "True"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc", "acc_norm"], "doc_hash": "647c94c839a3978580a5bdd1b9deb89dec347d9266ca92237795a9092e0e3363", "prompt_hash": "d779f9377b8ac1dfefc6f2e869e35c1cf896e398dbc168dcc41ab162ba31d976", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}

The sexual organs (carpels and stamens) are located at the center of the flower. As illustrated in Figure 26.14, styles, stigmas, and ovules constitute the female organ: the gynoecium or carpel. Flower structure is very diverse, and carpels may be singular, multiple, or fused. Multiple fused carpels comprise a pistil. The megaspores and the female gametophytes are produced and protected by the thick tissues of the carpel. A long, thin structure called a style leads from the sticky stigma, where pollen is deposited, to the ovary, enclosed in the carpel. The ovary houses one or more ovules, each of which will develop into a seed upon fertilization. The male reproductive organs, the stamens (collectively called the androecium), surround the central carpel. Stamens are composed of a thin stalk called a filament and a sac-like structure called the anther. The filament supports the anther, where the microspores are produced by meiosis and develop into pollen grains.\nQuestion: What is the purpose of bright colors on a flower's petals?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " to attract a mate"}, "gen_args_3": {"arg_0": "Flowers Flowers are modified leaves, or sporophylls, organized around a central stalk.

Thomson’s cathode ray tube showed that atoms contain small, negatively charged particles called electrons. Millikan discovered that there is a fundamental electric charge—the charge of an electron. Rutherford’s gold foil experiment showed that atoms have a small, dense, positively charged nucleus; the positively charged particles within the nucleus are called protons.

Quantum Numbers Schrödinger’s approach uses three quantum numbers (n, l, and ml) to specify any wave function. The quantum numbers provide information about the spatial distribution of an electron. Although n can be any positive integer, only certain values of l and ml are allowed for a given value of n.

It can arise from muscle overuse, trauma, excessive or prolonged pressure on the skin, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or infection of the joint. Repeated acute episodes of bursitis can result in a chronic condition. Treatments for the disorder include antibiotics if the bursitis is caused by an infection, or anti-inflammatory agents, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids if the bursitis is due to trauma or overuse. Chronic bursitis may require that fluid be drained, but additional surgery is usually not required.\nQuestion: Bursitis is the inflammation of a bursa near what?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " muscle"}, "gen_args_3": {"arg_0": "Bursitis Bursitis is the inflammation of a bursa near a joint. This will cause pain, swelling, or tenderness of the bursa and surrounding area, and may also result in joint stiffness. Bursitis is most commonly associated with the bursae found at or near the shoulder, hip, knee, or elbow joints. At the shoulder, subacromial bursitis may occur in the bursa that separates the acromion of the scapula from the tendon of a shoulder muscle as it passes deep to the acromion. In the hip region, trochanteric bursitis can occur in the bursa that overlies the greater trochanter of the femur, just below the lateral side of the hip. Ischial bursitis occurs in the bursa that separates the skin from the ischial tuberosity of the pelvis, the bony structure that is weight bearing when sitting. At the knee, inflammation and swelling of the bursa located between the skin and patella bone is prepatellar bursitis (“housemaid’s knee”), a condition more commonly seen today in roofers or floor and carpet installers who do not use knee pads.

Consequently, when liquid hydrogen evaporates, the heavier isotopes are concentrated in the last portions to evaporate. Electrolysis of heavy water, D2O, yields deuterium. Most tritium originates from nuclear reactions.\nQuestion: What element is the most abundant in the universe?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " oxygen"}, "gen_args_1": {"arg_0": "Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. The sun and other stars are composed largely of hydrogen. Astronomers estimate that 90% of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen is a component of more compounds than any other element. Water is the most abundant compound of hydrogen found on earth. Hydrogen is an important part of petroleum, many minerals, cellulose and starch, sugar, fats, oils, alcohols, acids, and thousands of other substances. At ordinary temperatures, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and nonpoisonous gas consisting of the diatomic molecule H2. Hydrogen is composed of three isotopes, and unlike other elements, these isotopes have different names and chemical symbols: protium, 1H, deuterium, 2H (or “D”), and tritium 3H (or “T”).

Additional branches from the ventral nerve root continue through the chain and on to one of the collateral ganglia as the greater splanchnic nerve or lesser splanchnic nerve. For example, the greater splanchnic nerve at the level of T5 synapses with a collateral ganglion outside the chain before making the connection to the postganglionic nerves that innervate the stomach (see Figure 15.3c). Collateral ganglia, also called prevertebral ganglia, are situated anterior to the vertebral column and receive inputs from splanchnic nerves as well as central sympathetic neurons. They are associated with controlling organs in the abdominal cavity, and are also considered part of the enteric nervous system. The three collateral ganglia are the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion (see Figure 15.2). The word celiac is derived from the Latin word “coelom,” which refers to a body cavity (in this case, the abdominal cavity), and the word mesenteric refers to the digestive system.\nQuestion: Collateral ganglia controls organs in which cavity in the body?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " pelvic"}, "gen_args_2": {"arg_0": "To continue with the analogy of the circuit diagram, there are three different types of “junctions” that operate within the sympathetic system (Figure 15.3). The first type is most direct: the sympathetic nerve projects to the chain ganglion at the same level as the target effector (the organ, tissue, or gland to be innervated). An example of this type is spinal nerve T1 that synapses with the T1 chain ganglion to innervate the trachea. The fibers of this branch are called white rami communicantes (singular = ramus communicans); they are myelinated and therefore referred to as white (see Figure 15.3a). The axon from the central neuron (the preganglionic fiber shown as a solid line) synapses with the ganglionic neuron (with the postganglionic fiber shown as a dashed line). This neuron then projects to a target effector—in this case, the trachea—via gray rami communicantes, which are unmyelinated axons. In some cases, the target effectors are located superior or inferior to the spinal segment at which the preganglionic fiber emerges. With respect to the “wiring” involved, the synapse with the ganglionic neuron occurs at chain ganglia superior or inferior to the location of the central neuron. An example of this is spinal nerve T1 that innervates the eye.

Acetyl-CoA is used in a myriad of biochemical pathways. For example, it may be used as the starting material for the biosynthesis of lipids (such as triglycerides, phospholipids, or cholesterol and other steroids). Most importantly for energy generation, it may enter the citric acid cycle and be oxidized to produce energy, if energy is needed and oxygen is available.

Is the VBNC state an unusual way of living for prokaryotes? In fact, most of the prokaryotes living in the soil or in oceanic waters are non-culturable. It has been said that only a small fraction, perhaps one percent, of prokaryotes can be cultured under laboratory conditions. If these organisms are non-culturable, then how is it known whether they are present and alive? Microbiologists use molecular techniques, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify selected portions of DNA of prokaryotes, demonstrating their existence. Recall that PCR can make billions of copies of a DNA segment in a process called amplification.\nQuestion: Some bacteria cannot be cultured because they are obligate intracellular parasites and cannot be grown outside what?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " host cell"}}, "resps": [[["-19.29119110107422", "False"]], [["-18.865802764892578", "False"]], [["-21.44351577758789", "False"]], [["-4.845785140991211", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-19.29119110107422", "False"], ["-18.865802764892578", "False"], ["-21.44351577758789", "False"], ["-4.845785140991211", "False"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc", "acc_norm"], "doc_hash": "233d796ad87a0c45f959528f81aa7c02788754251e1f446c2f6ebd933ceaf391", "prompt_hash": "b629f2028d6e6d3c0f666946e16645c9af3010d1e1f64b7fce3f478037507833", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}

The climate of these areas is warm and wet. Photosynthesis can proceed at a high rate, enzymes can work most efficiently, and stomata can remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration; together, these factors lead to the maximal amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) moving into the plant, resulting in high biomass production. The aboveground biomass produces several important resources for other living things, including habitat and food. Conversely, dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass. The animal communities living there will also be affected by the decrease in available food.\nQuestion: What is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food, and involves measuring biomass in terrestrial environments?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " decomposition energy"}, "gen_args_2": {"arg_0": "Abiotic Factors Influencing Plant Growth Temperature and moisture are important influences on plant production (primary productivity) and the amount of organic matter available as food (net primary productivity). Net primary productivity is an estimation of all of the organic matter available as food; it is calculated as the total amount of carbon fixed per year minus the amount that is oxidized during cellular respiration. In terrestrial environments, net primary productivity is estimated by measuring the aboveground biomass per unit area, which is the total mass of living plants, excluding roots. This means that a large percentage of plant biomass which exists underground is not included in this measurement.

The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of string and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not maintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions of the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which hydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or between two or more adjacent polypeptide chains. The secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the protein’s tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the primary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds. A disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate polypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide subunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are called beta chains. When they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature. Denaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins lose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein denaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added. The contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated.

The CDC estimates that 80 percent of those 60 years and older have one or more chronic disease associated with deficiencies of the immune systems. This loss of immune function with age is called immunosenescence. To treat this growing population, medical professionals must better understand the aging process. One major cause of age-related immune deficiencies is thymic involution, the shrinking of the thymus gland that begins at birth, at a rate of about three percent tissue loss per year, and continues until 35–45 years of age, when the rate declines to about one percent loss per year for the rest of one’s life. At that pace, the total loss of thymic epithelial tissue and thymocytes would occur at about 120 years of age. Thus, this age is a theoretical limit to a healthy human lifespan. Thymic involution has been observed in all vertebrate species that have a thymus gland. Animal studies have shown that transplanted thymic grafts between inbred strains of mice involuted according to the age of the donor and not of the recipient, implying the process is genetically programmed. There is evidence that the thymic microenvironment, so vital to the development of naïve T cells, loses thymic epithelial cells according to the decreasing expression of the FOXN1 gene with age. It is also known that thymic involution can be altered by hormone levels. Sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone enhance involution, and the hormonal changes in pregnant women cause a temporary thymic involution that reverses itself, when the size of the thymus and its hormone levels return to normal, usually after lactation ceases. What does all this tell us? Can we reverse immunosenescence, or at least slow it down? The potential is there for using thymic transplants from younger donors to keep thymic output of naïve T cells high. Gene therapies that target gene expression are also seen as future possibilities.

The life cycle (Figure 28.10) of these animals can be described as polymorphic, because they exhibit both a medusal and polypoid body plan at some point in their life cycle.\nQuestion: Where on a jellyfish is the mouth opening located?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " underside"}}, "resps": [[["-14.35014533996582", "False"]], [["-13.162729263305664", "False"]], [["-9.561932563781738", "False"]], [["-8.380093574523926", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-14.35014533996582", "False"], ["-13.162729263305664", "False"], ["-9.561932563781738", "False"], ["-8.380093574523926", "False"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc", "acc_norm"], "doc_hash": "36a607d421e1e30183b0c75faafb01089f9a9582ccf1db5e8e22446bc43afa66", "prompt_hash": "0c84255f2465950e5eb89f04e0ab449ff499e9f306b835954960eb851b08e15a", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}

Hyposecretion of the corticosteroids can cause Addison’s disease, which may result in bronzing of the skin, hypoglycemia, and low electrolyte levels in the blood.\nQuestion: The body cannot sustain for very long the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine, hormones associated with what stress response?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " fight-or-flight"}}, "resps": [[["-17.44438362121582", "False"]], [["-14.340882301330566", "False"]], [["-23.203882217407227", "False"]], [["-6.6176371574401855", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-17.44438362121582", "False"], ["-14.340882301330566", "False"], ["-23.203882217407227", "False"], ["-6.6176371574401855", "False"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc", "acc_norm"], "doc_hash": "46d28f229f00fb14615fb81a2d1b87a03bd0e49321d820e10633e8f5c854b85c", "prompt_hash": "7cb74967c2f8fec6668edd25055d6bb8a3412e88b0fefd016817933e8137252c", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}

For signaling purposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+.

These molecules help to spread a signal through the cytoplasm by altering the behavior of certain cellular proteins. Calcium ion is a widely used second messenger. The free concentration of calcium ions (Ca2+) within a cell is very low because ion pumps in the plasma membrane continuously use adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) to remove it. For signaling purposes, Ca2+ is stored in cytoplasmic vesicles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, or accessed from outside the cell. When signaling occurs, ligand-gated calcium ion channels allow the higher levels of Ca2+ that are present outside the cell (or in intracellular storage compartments) to flow into the cytoplasm, which raises the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca2+. The response to the increase in Ca2+ varies, depending on the cell type involved. For example, in the β-cells of the pancreas, Ca2+ signaling leads to the release of insulin, and in muscle cells, an increase in Ca 2+ leads to muscle contractions. Another second messenger utilized in many different cell types is cyclic AMP (cAMP). Cyclic AMP is synthesized by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase from ATP (Figure 9.12).

They also promote the conversion of the epiphyseal plate to the epiphyseal line (i. , cartilage to its bony remnant), thus bringing an end to the longitudinal growth of bones. Additionally, calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, is produced by the kidneys and stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the digestive tract.\nQuestion: What gland secretes growth hormones?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " pituitary"}}, "resps": [[["-10.814517974853516", "False"]], [["-9.422666549682617", "False"]], [["-8.46578598022461", "False"]], [["-3.628875732421875", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-10.814517974853516", "False"], ["-9.422666549682617", "False"], ["-8.46578598022461", "False"], ["-3.628875732421875", "False"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc", "acc_norm"], "doc_hash": "62d3c44c264cae8dd48ebafe0a59171a57a2709ed01a300060be0ce82d3d70b6", "prompt_hash": "5d907d0a4d47a302281b692a18300d2d2f5d0a47d4c6d609a1fc570b86b675be", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}

Slightly larger than the typical capillary, the smooth muscle of the tunica media of the metarteriole is not continuous but forms rings of smooth muscle (sphincters) prior to the entrance to the capillaries. Each metarteriole arises from a terminal arteriole and branches to supply blood to a capillary bed that may consist of 10–100 capillaries. The precapillary sphincters, circular smooth muscle cells that surround the capillary at its origin with the metarteriole, tightly regulate the flow of blood from a metarteriole to the capillaries it supplies.

The neurotransmitters that are released into the chemical synapse are degraded quickly or get reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell so that the recipient nerve cell can recover quickly and be prepared to respond rapidly to the next synaptic signal.\nQuestion: Paracrine signals move by what method through the extracellular matrix?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " deposition"}, "gen_args_2": {"arg_0": "Paracrine Signaling Signals that act locally between cells that are close together are called paracrine signals. Paracrine signals move by diffusion through the extracellular matrix. These types of signals usually elicit quick responses that last only a short amount of time. In order to keep the response localized, paracrine ligand molecules are normally quickly degraded by enzymes or removed by neighboring cells. Removing the signals will reestablish the concentration gradient for the signal, allowing them to quickly diffuse through the intracellular space if released again. One example of paracrine signaling is the transfer of signals across synapses between nerve cells. A nerve cell consists of a cell body, several short, branched extensions called dendrites that receive stimuli, and a long extension called an axon, which transmits signals to other nerve cells or muscle cells. The junction between nerve cells where signal transmission occurs is called a synapse. A synaptic signal is a chemical signal that travels between nerve cells. Signals within the nerve cells are propagated by fast-moving electrical impulses. When these impulses reach the end of the axon, the signal continues on to a dendrite of the next cell by the release of chemical ligands called neurotransmitters by the presynaptic cell (the cell emitting the signal). The neurotransmitters are transported across the very small distances between nerve cells, which are called chemical synapses (Figure 9.3).

Although individual hypha must be observed under a microscope, the mycelium of a fungus can be very large with some species truly being “the fungus humongous. ” The giant Armillaria ostoyae (honey mushroom) is considered the largest organism on Earth, spreading across over 2,000 acres of underground soil in eastern Oregon; it is estimated to be at least 2,400 years old.\nQuestion: Chitin, also found in the exoskeleton of insects, gives structural strength to the cell walls of fungi. the cell wall protects the cell from what?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " desiccation and predators"}}, "resps": [[["-17.86617088317871", "False"]], [["-19.612947463989258", "False"]], [["-12.868751525878906", "False"]], [["-1.300370216369629", "True"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-17.86617088317871", "False"], ["-19.612947463989258", "False"], ["-12.868751525878906", "False"], ["-1.300370216369629", "True"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc", "acc_norm"], "doc_hash": "819b5e5db54b3181884f2f7ab87649c4adc1914c068df9062383377af9f70df7", "prompt_hash": "a8ce4bdd96915a8da503836d442c782d5821d248ad0840af74da2d645a9a9277", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}

Oxygen and carbon dioxide are dissolved into the CSF, as they are in blood, and can diffuse between the fluid and the nervous tissue.\nQuestion: As the telencephalon enlarges and grows into the cranial cavity, it is limited by the space within what bone structure?\nAnswer:", "arg_1": " skull"}}, "resps": [[["-8.786531448364258", "False"]], [["-12.523343086242676", "False"]], [["-14.802196502685547", "False"]], [["-2.478231906890869", "False"]]], "filtered_resps": [["-8.786531448364258", "False"], ["-12.523343086242676", "False"], ["-14.802196502685547", "False"], ["-2.478231906890869", "False"]], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["acc", "acc_norm"], "doc_hash": "bd8a379c69be19c769bc6642298eea30f42194545a7a73cda1c5a07d21851987", "prompt_hash": "f1dba98fc9aff827e25baa600e2bb9f67cfe2b588984616a17e4971d82a4f538", "target_hash": "4e07408562bedb8b60ce05c1decfe3ad16b72230967de01f640b7e4729b49fce", "acc": 1.0, "acc_norm": 1.0}
